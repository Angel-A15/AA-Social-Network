to be applied for social network web applications where the user can share their thoughts, react to friends'
thoughts, and create a friend list. It is available for anyone to incorperate into their own work.

  (Mongoose is similar in a way to mysql, what makes it different 
  is its ability to conveniently add/exclude data without disrupting
  the rest of the code and giving some variables to new data such as
  an id.)
  
  * POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET API routes that enable to 
  create, delete, update, and retrieve data from the database and
  format the data through JSON for display.

## Installation

acquired by writing "npm i" into their terminal.
